    <h2>Fact</h2>
    <p>
      It is somewhat ironic that Lady Liberty is an iconic symbol of freedom and the American Dream when she started her life in Paris. French sculptors Bartholdi and Eiffel built her to celebrate the friendship between the US and France. You likely recognize the latter sculptor’s name from another famous French structure!
      In 1885, they sent Lady Liberty in 350 pieces packed into 214 crates. Though her flame-holding right arm arrived much earlier in 1876. So, the Americans displayed it in Philadelphia until the rest caught up with her.
      When her body caught up, they assembled her and displayed her at the final location in New York Harbor!

    <h2>Fact</h2>
    <p>
      No list of interesting facts about New York is complete without mentioning the city’s diverse population. As a collective, the city’s citizens speak around 800 languages. Almost half of New York households speak more than one language and one-third are born overseas. And because New York has the biggest population of any US city, 1 in 38 people in the United States are New Yorkers.
